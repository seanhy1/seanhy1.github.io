The 45 year old baseball icon played his **final** major
league game on March 21st in Japan. He played in parts of
19 seasons in the majors and nine in Japan's Nippon
Professional Baseball league. Ichiro never failed to live
up to the hype of his star status. Stating in 2002, *"I'm
unique. I'm a very rare kind of player,"* Ichiro proved to
all fans that he in fact was a generational talent that the
game of baseball will forever cherish for the remainder of
history.


## Ichiro's Impact on the Game
<blockquote> "He may not have surpassed Rose in hits, but
to make it into the hall of fame in two countries seems to
perfectly encapsulate a player who had the unique distinction
of being a superstar in two leagues — a feat capped perfectly
by his final games as a professional coming in Japan. Adding
up what he did between the leagues in an accurate manner may
be difficult, but declaring it to have been rare — to use
Suzuki’s word — is remarkably easy."

### **Accolades**
He came into this organization in 2001 as Japan’s most
prolific hitter, and 19 years, 10 All-Star appearances, 10 Gold
Gloves, two batting titles, and 3,089 hits later, will ultimately
end up in [Cooperstown.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2019/02/16/ichiro-suzuki-grateful-final-ride-mariners/2894063002/)


### **Stats**
A .311 hitter in the majors and a .353 hitter in Japan, Suzuki is
perhaps the greatest spray hitter in history regardless of league.
He hit for very little power — despite being known for prodigious
blasts in batting practice — and drew relatively few

### **Legacy**
The surefire Hall of Famer will go down as one of the greatest hitters
of all-time and certainly the best Japan-born player in recent
[memory.](https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/ichiro-suzuki-retires-mlb-baseball-seattle-mariners-japan)
